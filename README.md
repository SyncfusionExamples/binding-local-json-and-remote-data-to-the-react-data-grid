## Introduction
Wondering how to bind external data to the React Data Grid? On this episode of React Data Grid, you will see how to bind the React Data Grid with local JSON and remote data using the Data Manager and AJAX libraries.  
The easiest way to populate the React Data Grid is by binding a simple JSON object collection. However, you can bind a remote URL service to the React Data Grid by using the DataManager, AJAX, fetch API or any HTTP clients like Axios, which will fetch the data from the remote server and populate the Data Grid.
Apart from these data binding options, you will also see the following topics:
-	How to create a custom adaptor and add a new column with auto generated values.
-	How to perform all grid operations in the client side using offline mode.
-	How to send additional query parameters to the server.
